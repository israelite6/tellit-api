      "I don't believe religion is the problem of our so-called democratic state (Nigeria). Refusing to implement our laws is the problem. It's what causes bias, religious sentiments and restrictions. \n\nThe religion of a democratic ruler shouldn't matter, so far as he is not bias in dealing with other religions outside his own. Every man has equal rights. Chapter IV of the CFRN, 1999 (as amended) does not not give rights to only Christians or only muslims. It's for every man. But there can be bias even with a non-religious leader. The power is actually in our laws, not the leader. But the problem is, in Nigeria, our constitution is anything but a grundnorm. How much less, the other laws?",

    answer:
      '<p><br></p><p>That‚Äôs a very good question. If you  want to target the best online products audience in facebook ads, you have to take note of these two things; your ad copy and your target audience. If you don‚Äôt get them right you will waste your time, money and energy. What is an ad copy and how does it affect my sales?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1)Ad copy</strong></p><p>An ad copy is the content of your advert. There are certain guidelines and principles you need to follow in creating an ad copy. Once you follow them, it becomes a walk in the park. Here are the most important guidelines you need to follow. There are 9 of them. You can call them the 9 COMMANDMENTS in facebook ads marketing.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>#1. Your ad copy must arrest attention; </strong>This is the most important commandment of creating an ad copy. The reason is because if your advert doesn‚Äôt attract attention no one would notice it. For facebook ads, the best way to arrest attention is to have a powerful headline and a nice clear portrait picture. Don‚Äôt try to be creative and leave the juice to the end. Do something from the first second. For example; you want to run an advert for your new product (hair cream) for those who fancy having a dark hair. Why not have a headline like this ‚ÄúGet a dark hair in one week‚Äù than ‚Äú Buy our (product name) to get a dark hair‚Äù.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>#2.your ad copy must contain an offer</strong>; Nigerians like freebies. They always want something to ginger them to act. Imagine you see two adverts on facebook from different company offering the same services. Let‚Äôs say an insurance company,</p><p>Advert 1 says</p><p>&nbsp;‚ÄúInnosuccess insurance.&nbsp;In these turbulent times, you need an insurance partner to count on. Solid, caring and reliable.‚Äù</p><p>Advert 2 says</p><p>‚Äú Mr Kings vehicle insurance. Insure your car and get 50% off your renewal.‚Äù</p><p>Which of the advert above will catch your attention? It is obvious that the second advert has an offer.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>#3. Your ad copy should have a call to action ‚ÄúCTA‚Äù;</strong>I mentioned earlier an offer will make your prospects respond to your offer but you have to tell them to do it. It has to be something like;</p><p>For free consultation, send an email to‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..</p><p>&nbsp;For free access to our articles and interactive session, visit‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.</p><p>To read the rest, click‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..</p><p>To place an order, call 090XXXXX</p><p><strong>#4. Your ad copy must create a sense of urgency;</strong>One thing you must know for sure is that 21st century buyers are lazy and busy. I‚Äôm also guilty of that, I will be like I will check later, I will order later, I will make enquiries later. It is always later. This is why your ad copy should create a sense of urgency. For example, don‚Äôt&nbsp;mind me I like giving examples for better understanding. Assuming you want to run ads for your new boutique. Your ad copy should have something like;</p><p>‚ÄúJames boutique. Get 50% discount when you visit our boutique for the first time. Offer valid for&nbsp;50 customers. Call 090xxx to book your slot‚Äù.</p><p><strong>#5. You must test; </strong>My students hate me for this because whenever I give them assignments to create an ad copy, I will tell them to create 5 each. If you don‚Äôt like wasting money, oops too bad. This commandment is a must follow for you. It helps in getting the most results from your advertising efforts. You have to produce 2-5 ad copies to see which ads converts faster. That way, you will put most of your advertising budget into what works.</p><p>Note; your opinion doesn‚Äôt count. Let me repeat YOUR OPINION IS USELESS, IT DOESN‚ÄôT COUNT. Don‚Äôt think because a particular ad copy looks attractive to you means it will convert faster. For example,&nbsp;you run&nbsp;ads for your online course and you have something like these on your 3 different adverts;</p><p>1.Bring a friend and get&nbsp;free voucher for our premium course</p><p>2. If our course is not educative, don‚Äôt pay for it</p><p>3. Pay for a course and get one free</p><p>You might be thinking no.3 would bring more people in. Don‚Äôt be surprised that no.2 out performs the others. Concentrate on the ad copy that brings more customers. That is smart marketing.</p><p><strong>#6.you must establish credibility</strong>; why should they trust you? Why should they believe you ? Why should they patronize you? You are nobody. You have to establish credibility by:</p><p>Get some people to use your products and give testimony. Share their testimony</p><p>Get an expert endorse your product for you.</p><p>If you are using a website; you can have options like good looking interface, easy web navigation etc</p><p><strong>#7. Your ad copy should take the risk away from their potential customers; </strong>every buying decision is like a gamble. If you are buying something online, you are scared of not getting the product the way you saw them on net. So how can you take the risk way from potential customers? You can do that by; offering a money back guarantee, service change guarantee, product change guarantee etc.</p><p><strong>#8. Use the right words</strong>; facebook ban ads that contain offensive or harsh words. Words that make the customers feel bad about themselves. If you want to run an ad for a product that cures cancer, your ads shouldn‚Äôt&nbsp;start with ‚Äú If you don‚Äôt want cancer to kill you, buy this ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Äù. The word ‚ÄúKill‚Äù would make your customers feel bad because you just remind them&nbsp;of their greatest fear. It should be‚Äù get rid of cancer‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p><p><strong>#9. Take the bull by the horn; </strong>Its not an English class or a project where&nbsp;you will make your ad copy long and ambiguous. Make your sentence simple, apt and attractive. Facebook has limits of words for writing an ad copy besides people are lazy and busy. Nobody has time to read your long ad copy. It should not be too long nor too short. You can make it 50-&nbsp;150 words.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2). Define your target audience</strong></p><p>People often make this mistake when running&nbsp;ads on facebook. They will select all demographics without selecting their specific target audience. Maybe because they want to reach a larger audience. It is better to reach 50k audience with 45k respondents than to reach 300k with 10k response. It saves cost. Defining your audience makes it easier for your ads to reach&nbsp;potential customers . I don‚Äôt expect you running an advert for a RELATIONSHIP class and you include (2-10 yrs of age) in your demographics. They are many free mode users that like clicking ads to waste your budget. Take note.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;I hope&nbsp;I have answered your question. Thanks for reading. If you have more questions , your are free to ask. We are here at your service.</p>',

      '<p><br></p><p>Touch ID is a fantastic feature, but sometimes it can be a little fussy. Essentially, several things need to go exactly right for it to function correctly. If there is one problem along the way, it won‚Äôt work at all.</p><p>To make things easy for you, we‚Äôve put the steps in order working from easier to more complex directions to address the problem. Even if you have already tried some of these steps be sure to start from the beginning. Also, after completing each step try Touch ID once again to see if it works.</p><p>1) Make Sure Your Finger and Fingerprint Reader is Dry and Clean</p><p>Use a microfiber cloth‚Äîthe same kind you use for sunglasses or your computer screen‚Äî to remove any debris or dirt that may be on your device on your finger that may prevent the reader from functioning properly. In some cases, even a tiny drop of water or sweat can prevent your iPhone from reading your fingerprint.</p><p>If your Home button is looking dirty, clean it was a slow, light circular motion around the Home button. Then reverse direction and gently clean the other way to remove any dirt. Now reboot your phone and give Touch ID another try.</p><p>2) Scan Your Fingerprint with the Right Technique</p><p>Touch ID is sensitive. You need to use it the right way. All you do is lightly touch the home button giving the reader a couple of seconds to read your fingerprint. Don‚Äôt press down hard on the button. Instead, make sure your whole finger is lying on the reader while keeping it still.</p><p>Sometimes, you might need to rest your finger on the reader and then press the Home button once to unlock. You can enable/disable this feature under the Accessibility tab in settings. Select Rest Finger to Open under the home button options.</p><p>3) Check Your Case and Screen Protector</p><p>It‚Äôs easy for cases and screen protectors to move out of alignment and block the fingerprint scanner. Also, they may trap excessive heat sometimes which can prevent the Touch ID sensor from scanning your print.</p><p>4) Turn Touch ID Off and On</p><p>If a normal restart fails to fix your phone, then refresh your Touch ID by simply turning the feature off and on. Under your iPhone settings select Touch ID &amp; Passcode . After entering your passcode, disable iPhone Unlock and other features. Reset your devices and then enable again.</p><p>5) Do a Hard Reboot</p><p>If these steps haven‚Äôt helped them maybe you need to do a hard restart. Hard restarts clear more memory for a more thorough reset. Don‚Äôt worry, it won‚Äôt remove any of your data. To do a hard reset follow these steps:</p><p>For iPhone 8 Later or Later</p><p>Press and release the Volume Up, followed by a quick press and release of the Volume Down button. Finally, press and release the Side button until the Apple Logo appears.</p><p>For Earlier Models:</p><p>iPhone 7 and 7 Plus: Press and hold both the Volume Down and Side buttons for ten seconds or longer until the Apple logo appears. If the ‚Äúslide to restart‚Äù message shows, ignore it until the white screen appears.</p><p>iPhone 6S and before : Press and hold the Home and</p><p>Side buttons for over ten seconds. Ignore the slide bar if it pops up. Keep holding until you see the white screen. Sometimes it can take 20 or even 30 seconds to reset.</p><p>6) Delete and Add New Fingerprint</p><p>Many users are able to fix the problem simply by deleting the old fingerprint and creating a new one. Under your iPhone settings choose Touch ID &amp; Passcode, select each fingerprint and hit Delete Fingerprint .</p><p>Restart the phone. And then select the Add a Fingerprint option. Input your fingerprints.</p><p>7) Reset Your Network Settings</p><p>This may sound strange, but some users have been able to fix an iPhone Touch ID not working through resetting their network settings. Under the General tab in settings select Reset and choose Reset Network Settings. Restart your phone and give it a try.</p><p>8) Do a Factory Reset</p><p>Factory resets aren‚Äôt a scary as they seem. If you regularly sync and backup your iPhone, you really have nothing to worry about. Factory resets will also give you a nice fresh start on your phone. Connect your phone to the computer or iCloud and do a quick check to make sure everything is recently synced. Then under Settings, select Reset All Content and Settings. You‚Äôll have to set up everything again from scratch so save this as one of your last options.</p><p>9) Restore Phone Via iTunes</p><p>If none of these solutions are helpful to you then connect your phone to your computer and open iTunes. From iTunes, you can do a full restore of your iPhone. Although, you should do this an absolute last effort as it‚Äôs an even deeper reset of your phone. Once again make sure you‚Äôve backed up all your important data to iCloud beforehand.</p><p>Unable to activate Touch ID on iPhone</p><p>Some people may not to be able to activate touch ID and receive a message saying ‚ÄúUnable to complete Touch ID setup‚Äù or the feature appears greyed out. These above steps likely won‚Äôt be able to help you.</p><p>Instead, begin with the hard reboot from Step 5. You may also want to update your iOS and reset to factory settings. Now follow these steps:</p><p>1) Unplug your iPhone</p><p>Sometimes issues with the iPhone cable either overheating or causing software issues can prevent Touch ID from working. Remove the cable from your phone.</p><p>2) Turn off your passcode</p><p>Under settings, select Turn Passcode Off in the Touch ID &amp; Passcode section. Disabling the passcode enables a soft reset of security settings. Restart your phone and then enable your passcode again. Then try to set up your Touch ID. This behind the scenes work can trigger a fix to the system.</p><p>3) Sign Out of Your Apple ID</p><p>Under settings, select your name. Then choose Sign out. Follow the steps and then log back in and attempt to set up your Touch ID.</p><p>My iPhone Touch ID Still is Not Working!</p><p>If you‚Äôve followed all of these steps, and you‚Äôre still not having luck with your Touch ID, chances are you may have a serious problem going on. The sensor on your phone may be faulty or damaged. In this case, you‚Äôll likely need to contact Apple for support.</p><p>Be sure to mention to them that you‚Äôve already gone through all the steps above so they don‚Äôt waste your time. Over the phone or online, there‚Äôs not much else they will be able to do. Depending on your warranty status, you may be able to take it to your local Genius Bar or send your phone to Apple and they‚Äôll be able to make the repair for you.</p><p>If your Applecare plan has expired already, you can also find DIY kits online to replace your home button. You can do it yourself and the process is relatively easy, taking less than an hour to do at home.</p>',

The concept of Logic, science and facts seem too arduous a thing to contemplate for us so we revert back to a system that make it safe and acceptable to shroud the truth in mystery and divinity. Religion provides a safe and naiive way to explain away the hardest matters; simply saying "God knows best"(which is the truth though) can absolve an African of any responsibility, feelings of bewilderment, desire to seek change and it provides a perfect justification to be irresponsible. Religion is powerful it justifies and encourages mystries, It provides no solution in a weirdly comforting way and its widely accepted  by Africans  so its the perfect cover. Its just the way it is. </p>',
